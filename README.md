I have a **[website](http://svaught.com)** that I haven't updated in forever hehe

Quick links to some of the more interesting projects I've worked on solo:
- [CHIP-8 Emulator](https://svaught.com/project/chip8/)
- [Wetlab App](https://svaught.com/project/wetlab/)
- [NES Emulator](https://github.com/Svaught598/cppNES)

### More Stuff

- Iâ€™m currently working on an NES emulator in C++, it's around here somewhere
- Always down to learn more about various computational areas, particularly low-level stuff

### Future Plans
- Creating a Gameboy emulator using C++ and ![ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- I should probably learn more about web technologies hehe
- Maybe do some Physics stuff, golf ball dynamics look kind of interesting: [the Magnus Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect) is really cool!

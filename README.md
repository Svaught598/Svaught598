Head to **[my website](http://svaught.com)** to read about more about my projects!

Quick links to some of the more interesting ones:
- [CHIP-8 Emulator](https://svaught.com/project/chip8/)
- [Wetlab App](https://svaught.com/project/wetlab/)
- [Infection Simulation](https://svaught.com/project/infection/)

### More Stuff

- Iâ€™m currently working on a Flask website that does stuff with words and markov chains, it's cool, I promise :)
- Always keen to learn more about various computational areas with avid fascination in all (well, most) things low-level
- Particularly interested in data analysis and computational/statistical models.

### Future Plans
- Creating a Gameboy emulator using C++ and ![ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- Developing a dashboard using ![Plotly](https://plotly.com/) to learn more about data science things.
- Maybe do some exploratory simulation of golf ball dynamics, ![the Magnus Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect) is really cool!
